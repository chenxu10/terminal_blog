# README

This is a learning by building project. In this project, I built up a simple terminal blog based on the local MongoDB database.

I tried to train myself to use the following tasks to finish this project:

+ Use the Linux command line in CentOS system and command line in Git Bash to push and pull files to the remote repository
+ Get familiar with the IDE PyCharm and frequent shortcuts
+ Use the command line of mongo(insert,delete,query) and PyMongo package to interact with MongoDB database in python3.
+ Use object-oriented programming to design a very simple system
